Hi, I'm Tim Hrovat, a computer science student and software developer @ eÅ ola d.o.o. from Ljubljana, Slovenia.

In the next few years, I plan to expand my knowledge in the software development field and continue my path to becoming a software engineer.

I am always open to collaboration, so you can always reach out to me.
