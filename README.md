Hi, I'm Tim Hrovat, an 18-year-old computer science student from Ljubljana, Slovenia.

Aged 14, I wrote my first lines of code, and since then, I have been intrigued by it. Besides programming, I'm passionate about learning how things operate behind the scenes and tinkering with microcontrollers.

In the next few years, I plan to expand my knowledge in the software development field and continue my path to becoming a software engineer.

I am always open to collaboration, so you can always reach out to me.
